ui.py is automatically generated and provided for convenience. Do NOT change it's contents, the changes will be overwritten.
UI changes should be made to Editor.ui via Qt Designer. Do not rename objects without also changing the variable names in main.py!
Batch file contains command to compile Editor.ui to ui.py, but PyQt5 must be properly installed.
